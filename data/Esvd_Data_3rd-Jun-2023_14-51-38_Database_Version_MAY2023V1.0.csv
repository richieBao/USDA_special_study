The constructed wetland is at a latitude of 40040N and a longitude of 116340E in the North Temperate Zone with climate type of semi-humid temperate continental monsoon climate. The average daily temperature and precipitation in Beijing were 11.8 C and 578 mm in 2004 [23]. As a vertical subsurface-flow constructed treatment wetland near the Longdao River, the Beijing wetland [24?26] has a vegetated bed area of 602 m2 with a length and width of 28 m and 21.5 m respectively. With a daily treatment capacity of 200 m3, the effluent water fits the criterion for the fourth grade of ground water based on GB/T18921-2002 [27]. The construction cost of this engineering is 23,983 $ and the annual operation and maintenance expenditure is about 834 $/yr.
